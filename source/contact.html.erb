      <p class="lh-copy measure center">Dunn Vineyards isn’t your typical Napa winery -- it’s a small, working farm and family home.  While we love to have folks up and show them around, there’s limited availability. We don’t host guests on the weekends so Randy and Lori can relax after a week of work. We prefer to find a time during the week when we’re not tending to the vines, making wine, or fixing equipment. Send <%= mail_to 'kristina@dunnvineyards.com', "Kristina", :class => "dunn-link link txt-link" %> an email and she’ll try to work something out.</p> 
      <p class="lh-copy measure center">Email Kristina: <%= mail_to 'kristina@dunnvineyards.com', "kristina@dunnvineyards.com",:class => "dunn-link link txt-link" %></p>

        Visits to the winery can be reserved by contacting Kara Dunn, <%= mail_to'kara@dunnvineyards.com', 'kara@dunnvineyards.com', :class => "dunn-link link txt-link" %>.  We’re open by reservation M-F on a very limited basis, as we’re a small family operation.
