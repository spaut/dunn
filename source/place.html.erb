  <p class="lh-copy i mb0">We farm 35 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon on Howell Mountain. Since 1979 we’ve done our best to care for these vines so that they produce a wine that tastes like Cabernet Sauvignon from Howell Mountain. Today we are hands on in the vineyard, on the crush pad and in the cellar. Any more land and we would need to spend more time administering and managing we’d prefer to farm.</p>

    <h2 class="normal mt5 mb0">The Mountain</h2>
    <p class="lh-copy">Bill Smith led a group of 5 winemakers and grape growers to define what today is the Howell Mountain AVA. The AVA’s boundary starts at an elevation of 1400’ so even when it is cool and foggy on the valley floor, it is sunny and breezy up on the mountain. Randy was one of those pioneers and our wine epitomizes what has become synonymous with Howell Mountain Cabernet; deep concentration, bold, massive, ultra rich and elegant.</p>

        <h3 class="normal mt0 mb0 tc">Alta Tierra Vineyard</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy i mt0 tc">Formerly the "Trailer Vineyard"</p>
        <p class="lh-copy">This was the original vineyard purchased in 1978 by Randy and Lori. After the 2013 vintage we tore out the old vineyard, and began the replant. In 2016 we grafted Cabernet Sauvignon onto the rootstock and renamed the vineyard "Alta Tierra". The orientation of the vineyard is basically East/West the Cabernet is grafted on rootstock 3309c with spacing between 8 and 9 x 4.5 depending on the slope.</p>
        <h3 class="normal mt5 tc">Lake Vineyard</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy ">This vineyard is located directly adjacent to the winery and Randy and Lori’s home. Before this vineyard was planted, Randy and Mike grew hay for 20 years to feed the Dunn’s horses. These 8 acres are mostly cabernet sauvignon, except for a few rows of Syrah (for home consumption). There is also about 1 acre of Petite Sirah and Peloursin planted on the west border of the vineyard. Mike named this Los Abuelos and uses it for his Retro Cellars label. The Cabernet Sauvignon was planted in 3 blocks. Lake I was planted in 2000 using 101-14 rootstock. Lake II was planted in 2001 on 3309. The last block, Lake III, was planted also on 3309 in 2003. Each block contains a mix of 4 different clones; 337, 15, Dunn (from our Trailer Vineyard) and Frank (from the Harry Frank vineyard). This vineyard is the coolest of all, as it sits in a small valley, and requires overhead sprinklers for frost protection along with a wind machine.</p>

      <div class="fl w-100 w-50-l ph4">
        <h3 class="normal mt0 tc">Frank Vineyard</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy ">Named for Henry Frank who entrusted Randy with managing this vineyard for him back in 1979. Though we don’t own it, it feels very much like part of our land as it is nestled between two of our vineyards and farmed by us. This vineyard was planted in 1965 and we re-planted the two blocks in 1989 and 1993. The block planted in 1989 is on 110R rootstock and the 1993 block is planted to 3309. The vines are planted North/South.</p>
        <h3 class="normal mt5 tc">Park Muscatine Vineyard</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy ">This vineyard was purchased in 1991. The first block which we call “Cuervo” was replanted in 1991. The “JK” block was replanted in 1993, and it wasn’t until 5 years later that we replanted the block we simply call “Below House”. The fourth and final block within that vineyard was not replanted until 2016. Formerly the “Old Petite” block it was the fruit that Mike and Kara utilized to start their Retro Cellars project. Currently named the “Coyote” block. It has been planted to Cabernet Sauvignon.  Slopes and sun exposure vary along this 16 acre vineyard.</p>

    <p class="lh-copy measure i">Dunn’s winery sits in a fir forest high above the valley floor, a slightly scruffy compound with a ramshackle barn surrounded by agricultural equipment, outdoor fermentation tanks, and a fenced pasture with horses. The office is a former Western Union stagecoach stop. &mdash; Jay McInerney</p>

<p class="lh-copy">Randy and Lori’s first involvement in conservation was in 2004 with the <%= link_to "Napa Land Trust", "https://www.napalandtrust.org/",    target: :_blank, :class => 'link dunn-link dim'  %> in the form of an easement. The Sentinel Hill property consisted of 64-acres of completely forested land as you enter the town of Angwin on Howell Mountain. The next move was the Dunn’s gift of $5 million, the largest donation in the history of the Land Trust to help purchase the Wildlake Ranch a 3000 acre property up on the mountain.</p>


<p class="lh-copy">
There is a sense of urgency in the Napa Valley, and maybe world wide, to preserve what we have. The influx of big money coming into our area is putting tremendous pressure on our wild lands above the valley floor. Projects to cut down trees and plant vineyards are constantly being battled. 
</p>


<p class="lh-copy i">In life we have to decide what will define us and what we will leave behind for the next generation.</p>
