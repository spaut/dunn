        <h3 class="normal mt3 mb0">Randy Dunn</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy measure mb4 mb2-ns">Founder, farmer, activist and winemaking pioneer of Howell Mountain. Randy started his wine career working for Charlie Wagner as the first enologist for Caymus Vineyards, and never looked back. Now after all these years, not a lot has changed. More of a farmer, he’s hands-on in vineyards most days. His love for Howell Mountain led him to be instrumental in establishing it as a sub-AVA of Napa Valley. And if he’s not farming the mountain, he’s mountain biking on it, flying his plane over it, or finding ways to preserve it for future generations. He is happy to be called a dirt-loving hippie, but you’d probably think he’s more of a cowboy.

        <h3 class="normal mt3 mb0">Lori Dunn</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy measure mb4 mb2-ns">Co-founder of Dunn Vineyards and matriarch of the family, Lori is the glue that holds it all together. She managed everything from the accounting to the kids.  Happy not to be involved in the day to day tasks (especially waxing the bottles), she loves spending time with her grandkids, quilting, relaxing at her oasis on Bodega Bay, and making sure that the gardens meet her Master Gardner specifications.</p>

        <h3 class="normal mt3 mb0">Mike Dunn</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy measure mb4 mb2-ns">While he calls himself a “cellar grunt”, Mike actually oversees the production of the wine, works with the team in the vineyards, and manages the overall operation. An interest in experimenting with other varietals lead Mike and his wife Kara to purchase some old vine Petite Sirah from Randy and start their own label <%= link_to 'Retro Cellars',  'http://www.retrocellars.com', :class=>'dunn-link link txt-link' %>. Before becoming a full-time winemaker, Mike pursued his other interests. He graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1988 with a degree in Anthropology (surfing) and later owned a bike shop in Calistoga. He and Kara have two grown children who are currently on their own paths.  But he wouldn’t be surprised if, like their father, they end up farming grapes on Howell Mountain.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy measure mb4 mb2-ns">Marketer, mediator, and now mostly full-time mother, Kristina is the youngest of the Dunn children. After graduating Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a B.S. in Wine &amp; Viticulture, she returned to Howell Mountain to manage marketing, run hospitality, and resume her natural role as family mediator. These days she spends most of her time, along with her husband Brian, managing their two young daughters, but she's close by and ready to help out.

				<h3 class="normal mt2-m mb0">Jennifer Dunn</h3>
				<p class="lh-copy measure">It is safe to say, that we are who we are today because of the love Jenny brought to our lives. The oldest Dunn daughter loved softball and riding horses with Dad. But while attending Chico State, she contracted bacterial meningitis and passed away. In part because of Jenny's case, most institutions of higher learning now require vaccination &mdash; a requirement that has saved many lives.  </p>
