  <p class="lh-copy measure">&#8220;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,&#8221; and for Randy the beauty was Howell Mountain. In 1979, Randy and his wife Lori moved with their son Mike into a home on the outskirts of the quiet town of Angwin. While the valley floor inspired farmers to plant vineyards and make wine, Howell Mountain captured Randy&#8217;s heart. From these mountain vineyards the Dunn family made it&#8217;s mark on the wine industry and the land in turn made it&#8217;s mark on the family.</p>


<h2 class="normal mt5">Randy Dunn</h2>

<h2 class="normal mt5">Lori Dunn</h2>

<p class="lh-copy measure">Founder, owner, and family backbone. Loralee worked side by side with Randy during the early years, as well as handled the office. Her office duties might have ended with her full time duties as a mother to two young girls and a teenage boy, but Lori continued to work events. By no means did her responsibilities lessen over the years as she cared for the family, home and property.</p>


<h2 class="normal mt5">Michael &#8220;Mike&#8221; Dunn</h2>

<p class="lh-copy measure">Son, cellar master and assistant winemaker. Mike attended Davis and graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1988. Mike has been working full time since 1999 at the winery, each year taking on more and more responsibilities. He has also provided new information, practices and procedures. Mike and his wife, Kara, started their own wine label <a title="Retro Cellars" href="http://www.retrocellars.com" target="_blank">Retro Cellars</a> in 2003. He is enjoying making two different Petite Sirah wines. Mike and Kara have 2 beautiful children, one in an art college and the other in high school. Mike, who’s former career was owning and operating a mountain and road bike shop in Calistoga, is responsible for his family’s love of biking. When Mike isn’t working you might see him on a bike or singing. Music has been a passion of Mike’s for years, and it’s obvious if you engage him in the topic.</p>

<h2 class="normal mt5">Kristina Dunn</h2>

She has been working at the winery since 2007. Though her title is Director of Marketing, she enjoys helping out wherever she is needed, especially if it is on the crush pad. Kristina and Brian were married in 2010 and have two young daughters.</p>


<h2 class="normal mt5">Jenny Dunn</h2>
<p class="lh-copy measure">Last but not least- Jennifer Jean Dunn: Randy and Lori’s first daughter who passed away at 20 years old in 1999 of Bacterial Meningitis. She attended Chico State, loved riding horses with dad and playing softball. It is safe to say, that we are who we are today because of the love she brought into our lives.</p>
