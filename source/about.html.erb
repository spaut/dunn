<p class="lh-copy measure">I knew that I wanted to simplify things after my experience at Caymus. I didn’t want to be bottling into the back of a super market truck and didn’t want to be subjugated to the marketing department’s demands. “Keep it simple dummy."</p>

<h2 class="normal">Style</h2>
<p class="lh-copy measure">The mountain really determined the style of the wine. It became obvious right away that the grapes up here were much more powerful than down on the valley floor. I just made the wine itself the same way we did at Caymus, it just was a more tannic wine due to the place.</p> 

<h2 class="normal">Future</h2>
<p class="lh-copy measure">We have no intentions of increasing our production or growing the brand. The current size of our farm and its production allows us to be involved in all aspects. If it were any bigger the work would become much more administrative, managerial not to mention the amount of effort to sell the wine would increase exponentially and for us that’s not the fun part.</p>

<h2 class="normal ">The Winery</h2>
<p class="lh-copy measure i">Dunn’s winery sits in a fir forest high above the valley floor, a slightly scruffy compound with a ramshackle barn surrounded by agricultural equipment, outdoor fermentation tanks, and a fenced pasture with horses. The office is a former Western Union stagecoach stop. &mdash; Jay McInerney</p>
