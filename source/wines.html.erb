  <p class="lh-copy measure mb0"><i>Nothing is easygoing about Randy Dunn's Cabernets, whether it's the dense red wax atop the bottle you need to soften to access the cork, or the uncompromising style that has become his trademark. &hellip; The quietly fierce nature of Dunn's wines has never been for all comers. But Dunn has always prided himself on being different.</i></p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">Both of our wines are produced in the same classic way we've done it since 1979.</p>


<h2 class="normal mt5">Howell Mountain Cabernet</h2>
<p class="lh-copy measure">The Howell Mountain wines consist of one hundred percent Howell Mountain fruit farmed by us. One of the signatures of the Howell Mountain wine is that it is hand dipped in red wax.</p>

<h2 class="normal mt5">Napa Valley Cabernet</h2>
<p class="lh-copy measure">The Napa Valley wines are a blend of our Howell Mountain fruit and a small quantity of fruit that we purchase from two growers in Coombsville. This valley floor fruit contributes to the wine’s earlier approachability and softer tannic structure.</p>

  <h3>Notes & Questions</h3>
  <p class="lh-copy measure"><b>Highlight each wine:</b> I think it makes sense to highlight the wines separately. If there is a lot of info for each, then maybe they could have separate pages.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy measure"><b>Bottle shots:</b> If we're going to do them, it makes sense to put them here.</p>
