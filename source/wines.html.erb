  <p class="lh-copy measure mb0"><i>Nothing is easygoing about Randy Dunn's Cabernets, whether it's the dense red wax atop the bottle you need to soften to access the cork, or the uncompromising style that has become his trademark. &hellip; The quietly fierce nature of Dunn's wines has never been for all comers. But Dunn has always prided himself on being different.</i></p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">Dunn Vineyards produces two wines, Howell Mountain and Napa Valley. Both wines are one hundred percent Cabernet Sauvignon. The wines are made in the same classic manner that we have been making wine since 1979. Our total production varies from vintage to vintage, but we average close to 4500 total cases a year. The Howell Mountain wines consist of one hundred percent Howell Mountain fruit farmed by us. The Napa Valley wines are a blend of our Howell Mountain fruit and a small quantity of fruit that we purchase from two growers in Coombsville. This valley floor fruit contributes to the wine’s earlier approachability and softer tannic structure.</p>

  <h3>Notes & Questions</h3>
  <p class="lh-copy measure"><b>Highlight each wine:</b> I think it makes sense to highlight the wines separately. If there is a lot of info for each, then maybe they could have separate pages.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy measure"><b>Include more details:</b> Some of the competitors have "specs" about each wine like how many cases and how long in the barrell.  If I were a wine geek, I'd probably want to know that stuff. Whatever info we provide for one, we should provide for the other.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy measure"><b>Allocation:</b> It is natural to put something here on how to purchase the wine.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy measure"><b>Bottle shots:</b> If we're going to do them, it makes sense to put them here.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy measure"><b>Special Releases?:</b> Do you want to call out special things like the Trailer 2 pack?</p>
  <p class="lh-copy measure"><b>Vintages:</b> If there is wine you're still trying to move, do you want to call out any available vintages?</p>
